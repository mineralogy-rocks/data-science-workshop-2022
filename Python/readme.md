# Processing of geochemical data

Here we will load the *XRF* and *ICP-MS* analyses on mafic dykes from the Argentine Islands (West 
Antarctica). 

The tasks are as follows:

1. Install virtual environment using the command `python3 -m venv venv`.
2. Install the dependencies using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Look into the data:
   1. Look for duplicates. Why these are present?
   2. What are the data types? Are all correct?
