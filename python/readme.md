# Processing of geochemical data

Here we will learn the basics of Python and load the *XRF* and *ICP-MS* analyses on mafic dykes from the Argentine Islands (West 
Antarctica). 

The plan is as follows:

1. What is Python? Visit the [Official page](https://www.python.org/).
2. What is IDE? Install PyCharm from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
3. What is virtual environment? 
   1. Copy the project from github repository [data-science-workshop-2022](https://github.com/mineralogy-rocks/data-science-workshop-2022).
   2. Install virtual environment using the command `python3 -m venv venv`.
4. Install the dependencies using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Python basics: syntax and data types. 
6. Documentation. Always read it!
7. A quick introduction to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html).
8. Look into the data:
   1. Look for duplicates. Why these are present?
   2. What are the data types? Are all correct?
   3. What is a loop. Example.
   4. What is a function. Example.
   5. What is a class. Example.
9. Visualizations:
   1. TAS diagram.
   2. Binary plots of major oxides (MgO vs SiO2, etc).
